## Quick start

Both the extension and the Minecraft game itself need a Minecraft server to connect to. This extension provides a Dev
Service which automatically starts a modded server in a container, but the container needs to be built first.

### Build the minecraft server container

Accept the eula by changing eula=false to eula=true in the file `modded-minecraft/run/eula.txt`.

```bash
cd modded-minecraft
podman build -t minecraft-server .
```

The container build can be a bit slow the first time, be warned. If you're in a hurry, you can turn off dev services and
use `./gradlew runServer` instead. If you'd like to test the built container, you can run
`podman run -p 25565:25565 -p 8081:8081 minecraft-server.`
> **_INFO:_** First time you start the Minecraft server you will have to accept the eula by changing eula=false to
> eula=true in the file `modded-minecraft/run/eula.txt`

### Start the minecraft client

There are two ways to do this:

The best way to connect a client us to use the client in the Forge Minecraft library. This ensures compatibility with
the server. To launch it, run

```
cd modded-minecraft
./gradlew runClient
```

Start a multiplayer game, and connect to `localhost:25565`.

### Using the 'official' launcher and the Java edition of Minecraft

You can also use the normal Minecraft launcher, but only if the client and server versions exactly match.
Using the official client will allow you may need to set `online-mode` to true on the server, and get rid of a warning.

If using the official client, which will be un-modded, you will need to configure the client to allow you to `alt-tab`
away from the client without it pausing and bringing up
a menu. Edit `options.txt` in
your [minecraft folder](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/15664/can-i-alt-tab-out-of-minecraft-without-the-game-auto-pausing)
, and change `pauseOnLostFocus` to `false`.

### Build the extension

```bash
cd extension
mvn install
```

### Start the sample application

```bash
cd quarkus-todo-app
quarkus dev
```

(If you do `mvn install`, with podman it should be `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED="true" mvn install`.)

### Interact with the web app

Arrange your windows so you can see both the minecraft client and the web application.
Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). While you're interacting with the web app, you should see things
happen in the minecraft world. Visiting the page will cause a mob to spawn, and an exception (like a 404) will cause an
explosion.
